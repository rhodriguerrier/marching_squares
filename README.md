# marching_squares

A very basic implementation of marching squares
in order to practise Go with graphics and GUI.

This also includes some basic interpolation which
uses the random number assigned to each node in order
to slightly adjust the position of the isoline.
The purpose of this is to make the boundaries a little
more unique and less clunky.
